Global discussion lately has centered upon the effects of climate changes. A key way of stalling climate change has become renewable energy adoption. An important factor hindering Renewable Energy has been the lack of â€˜efficiencyâ€™ of methods utilized to harness the same. This paper aims to minimize the constraint for Solar energy by enabling efficient use of Solar Power through the development of a Machine Learning based model that predicts parameters related to Solar Radiation like efficiency and magnitude at a location. The models were trained and tested using a dataset encompassing a total of 664 days consisting of 11108 values obtained in southern Italy, comprising hourly Power output (kW) compared against Ambient temperature (Ta), Module temperature (Tm), and Irradiance for panels (W/m2). After initial preprocessing, data was separated into training and testing sets with regards to the LSTM and XG-Boost prediction models. Forecasting Process involved various techniques such as exploratory data analysis, time series forecasting, and regression analysis. As per results obtained, the XG-Boost Model gave the closest predictions to the actual parameters including the output power generated as per the dataset. Thus, the comparative analysis involved enhances perspectives on increasing efficacy of solar power predictions for future applications.
